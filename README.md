# TypeSnap
TypeSage is a deep learning-based tool for classifying typographies from images. Given an image containing text, this project identifies and categorizes the font style used. It can be used for digital archiving, design analysis, OCR preprocessing, or simply recognizing unknown fonts in visual data.
